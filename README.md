# A deep learning model based on whole slide images to predict disease-free survival in cutaneous melanoma patients 
The application of deep learning on whole-slide histological images (WSIs) can reveal insights for clinical and basic tumor science investigations. 
Finding quantitative imaging biomarkers from WSIs directly for the prediction of disease-free survival (DFS) in stage I-III melanoma patients is 
crucial to optimize patient management. In this study, we designed a deep learning-based model with the aim of learning prognostic biomarkers 
from WSIs to predict 1-year DFS in cutaneous melanoma patients.
